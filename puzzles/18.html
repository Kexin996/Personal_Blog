                        "you are a prisoner in a foreign land. your fate will be determined by a little game. there are two jars, one with 50 white marbles, and one with 50 black marbles. at this point, you are allowed to redistribute the marbles however you wish (e.g. swap a black marble with a white marble, etc.): the only requirement is that after you are done with the redistribution, every marble must be in one of the two jars. afterwards, both jars will be shaken up, and you will be blindfolded and presented with one of the jars at random. then you pick one marble out of the jar given to you. if the marble you pull out is white, you live; if black, you die. how should you redistribute the marbles to maximize the probability that you live; what is this maximum probability (roughly)?"

                        - First, we know that we cannot change the probability of choosing the jars. <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp; - that is, since there are two jars, choosing either will always be 50/50. <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp; - therefore, we want to maximize the probability of getting white in jars 1 and 2. <br><br>
                        
                        - The maximum probability is 1 ---> we can just put one white marble in a jar.<br><br>

                        - Then, we put the rest of the white marbles into the jar full of black marbles, and the final probability becomes:<br>
                            <center>P(white) = 0.5 * 1+ 0.5 * (49 / 99), which is roughly 75%.</center>

                        - We know that distance = time * velocity and the time in this problem is 'constant' ---> it is shared among train 1, train 2, and the bird. <br>
